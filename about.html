<h1>Personality</h1>

<p>According to my most recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungian_archetypes">Jungian Archetype Test</a>, I am a person with
    <a href="https://www.envisionyourevolution.com/the-jungian-personality-type-indicator/jungian-personality-type-2-esfj-the-caregiver/25339/">ESTJ</a> type
    (extraversion, sensing, feeling and judging).</p>

<p>ESFJs are typically warm, empathetic, and sociable individuals who place a high value on tradition, loyalty, and cooperation.
    They are practical, detail-oriented, and seek harmony in their relationships with others.
    I think these descriptions are quite precise on me.</p>

<h1>Hobbies</h1>
I have many hobbies: reading, eating, and running.

<h2>Reading</h2>

<p> My favorite book is <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus">The Myth of Sisyphus</a> (Le Mythe de Sisyphe)</i>
written by Camus. Camus tells a story that Sisyphus,
a figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to repeat forever the same meaningless task of pushing a boulder up a mountain,
    only to see it roll down again just as it nears the top. </p>

<p> The reason why I love <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i> is that I believe studying/doing research is just pushing a boulder up a mountain.
No matter what the results will be, we should consistently keep our pace to do so. </p>

<p>Stay Perseverant and Stay Optimistic.</p>
