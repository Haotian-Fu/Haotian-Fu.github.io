<p>Department of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University</p>
<p>Supervisor: <a href="https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~lijie/">Prof. Jie Li</a></p>

<h3>Contributions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Cooperated with Ph.D. Students to delve into the optimization of video streaming tasks of edge servers, proposed a novel method based on a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to enhance the performance of edge video stream analysis under long-term energy constraints</li>
  <li>Improved code framework for deep reinforcement learning, conducted video compression and offloading under long-term energy constraints to maximize the long-term rewards of video task processing</li>
  <li>Tested and analyzed the impact of activation functions, learning rates, exploratory strategies (ε−greedy), and other factors on deep reinforcement learning</li>
  <li>Conducted sensitivity analysis on learning rates and the number of agents, performed pressure testing on our proposed working flow</li>
  <li>Tuned hyperparameters for further optimization, successfully visualized data, and performed analysis by using Python</li>

<h2>Interpretation for the relationship between the age and geometric structure of brain using Multiple
Linear Regression</h2>

<p>UM-SJTU JI, Shanghai Jiao Tong University</p>
<p>Instructor: <a href="https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/faculty-detail/33871/">Prof. Ailin Zhang</a></p>

<h3>Contributions:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Aimed at carrying out reliable brain age prediction work based on the existing MRI image dataset</li>
  <li>Constructed 3 regression models for analysis of a 408-dimension dataset with 1600 samples, used three
feature selection method to deal with the predictors in high dimensional dataset</li>
  <li>Established a linear regression by using R to show an explicit and interpretable linear relationship between
brain age and brain geometric features</li>
  <li>Analyzed the dataset and eliminated the batch effect by using Python, matched model diagnostics with the
assumption of MLR</li>
  <li>Conducted model evaluation, statistical inference and parameter interpretation</li>
</ul>
